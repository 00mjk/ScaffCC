Gridsynth Package
=================
Gridsynth is an executable program developed by P. Selinger et al. Full documentation can be found on:
> http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/newsynth/

The role of the program in this software is to compute the approximation of arbitrary z-rotations over discrete Clifford+T gates. 
User may choose to download the tar package and install gridsynth from source [here](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/newsynth), in case the pre-compiled binary fails to work.
