2016-10-01:
	Release version -v2.0
	New data type abit added - representation of ancilla bits
	New function afree() added - usage: free ancilla bits and conserve usage
	throughout algorithms
	New function reverse() added - usage: reverse the computational steps of a
	specific function in an automated fashion
	New implementation of RKQC added - subcompiler call now directly inlined
	in an LLVM module pass
	Several small notational changes made to algorithms Boolean Formula, Class Number,
	RKQC_Test, and SHA-1
	New compilation flag to generate QX quantum computer simulator input files added - "-s",
	now algorithms can be compiled down to acceptably formatted input files
	for the QX quantum computer simulator available from TU Delft
2016-08-20:
	Release version - v1.0-beta.2
	Updates made to Class Number algorithm, corrections to QASM section
	Changes made to gen-lpfs.sh and gen-scheds.sh to allow for integration of coarse-grained scheduling with full schedule outputs of LPFS
	Changes made to GenLPFSSchedule.cpp to prepend metrics header to all LPFS scheduled functions for integration with CG scheduling
